# Gorlex

Flavor title: WIP

Gorlex are responsible for many of the heavy munitions, and total annihilation of facilities. They’re the opposite of the Syndicate, they’re LOUD and STRONG. 

Gorlex produces heavy munitions, those being souped up mechs, heavy ballistics, heavy robotics and special class medications and implants. They also produce nuclear fission bombs, many of which are also distributed to NanoTrasen stations, under a guise of another corporation. They also produce a certain class of ships and cruisers, which they also sell to NanoTrasen under another corporation.

Gorlex is feared by everyone, even NanoTrasen who have also deemed them as a terrorist organization. Gorlex has their fingers in every other corporation, except NanoTrasen. Despite their power, Gorlex has worked with each corporation closely to assemble their massive power. They have, on a few occasions, stolen patents from a few corporations (mostly Cybersun for their robotics and mechs).

Gorlex is responsible for arming specific elite Syndicate Agents, known as Nuclear Operatives (a shared division between Gorlex and the Syndicate). As a result, Gorlex does not hire anyone. They work closely with the Syndicate to both hand pick elite personnel that are to deliver out a very important, all or nothing, mission. Should their agents fail, and if they return, they’re usually met with execution, or are prisoned as criminals against Gorlex and the Syndicate. Gorlex is a firm believer in the “all or nothing” phrase, and they mean it. You either die, or don’t get caught if you fail.

Gorlex is the de facto corporation within the sphere of influence, only using their power when they themselves (and the Syndicate) believe someone else is using their own powers for evil or misuse. Due to the immense waste of manpower, munitions and general supplies it is to go and nuke a station, Gorlex is rarely contracted. Instead, 90% of their work is simply on building lesser grade munitions and mechs to distribute to the Syndicate. Some agents are considerably lucky if they can get their hands on a Gorlex made side arm, or mech (although this is extremely rare, as mechs are labor intensive and expensive to produce and buy). While not as strong as their Nuclear Operatives gear and equipment, they can still pack a significant punch compared to what the Syndicate can produce in house.
