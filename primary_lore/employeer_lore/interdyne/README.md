# Interdyne

Flavor title: WIP

The Interdyne is everyone's major pharmaceutical manufacturer. They're responsible for most of the medical goods shipped everywhere.
They're also responsible for a smaller quantity of medical weapons and specialized implants.

The Interdyne are held in high regards, according to the Syndicate. They're responsible for suppling all of the Syndicates agents with proper medical equipment, and sometimes a little more, if the Syndicate paid a little more.
As for everyone else, past medical and research mishaps have left everyone wary of Interdyne. However, these past mishaps never escape Interdyne facilities, and were relatively contained. No one knows if these mishaps were acts of terrorism, internal espionage from everyone is still on-going.

Everyone except the Syndicate keeps the Interdyne at an arm's length, keeping them on relatively good terms, but staying far away enough if an accident occurs.
No one wants to be responsible for cleaning up an Interdyne mess.

The Interdyne typically favor the hiring of previous, or current medical and research staff. Anyone who doesn't fall into this range are usually ignored by the corporation, but some exceptions have been made in the past.
These "exceptions'' have been recorded to never be heard from again. Investigations are ongoing.
