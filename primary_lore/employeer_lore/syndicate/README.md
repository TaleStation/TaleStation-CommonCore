# Syndicate

Flavor title: WIP

The Syndicate are responsible for most tactical missions in the sphere of influence. Espionage, assassination, theft, you name it, they do it.

The Syndicate are also responsible for the manufacturing of low-grade tech equipment, weapons, and basic stealth equipment. Some of these patents and designs have been shared amongst the other corporations in the sphere, although, against the Syndicates will in some cases.

The Syndicate are respected by most of the other corporations at large, except NanoTrasen. NT views the Syndicate as a terrorist organization, quoting them as "[A] hostile entity that infringes on our work". NT has worked tirelessly to combat the Syndicate in a decades long internal warfare. Due to this struggle, other corporations have been able to sneak under the radar and wedge themselves within NT ranks, some staying for life, others getting what they need and leaving when the job is done.

If theres specific work to be done, other corporations will go to the Syndicate first. Despite the reputation of who the Syndicate hires, surprisingly, their work is usually always fulfilled.

The Syndicate will hire anyone. Most of the Syndicates work force is made up of bums, looking to make a few quick bucks. Despite the ongoing war, the usual demise of these agents is death, or a life sentence in a NT high security prison. However, the Syndicate usually busts out some of these bums due to internal snakes who have latched their fangs within NTs corporate ladder.

You can't trust everyone in NanoTrasen anymore. They might as well sink a dagger into your back for their own greater good, or so multiple Syndicate press continue to write and feed news networks. NanoTrasen continues to work tirelessly to expunge any and all Syndicate agents from their ranks, both in the corporate ladder and in their stations.
