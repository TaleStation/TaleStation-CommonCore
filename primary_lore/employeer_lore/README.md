Employer lore is lore surrounding the multiple companies within TaleStation's lore.
They're not only responsible for antagonistic behavior, but for an array of products that both NanoTrasen uses, and the other employers.
They each have their own unique reputation, status, goods to manufacture and so on.
They, of course, specialize in their own specific departments of interest. For more information, check each module.
