# Tajaran's
### Lore Head: Jolly

## Home Planet

Kalt, a frozen plant engulfed in a near endless snowstorm.

The ground is permanently frozen, stuck in centuries of ice, making it incapable of being tilled, bare fruit or vegetable. Greenhouses were erected in numerous areas to help curb this issue.

## Seasons on Kalt
Kalt experiences two seasons: Snefald and Sol.

Snefald is the snowfall season, lasting for approximately 3 Earth seasons. During this time, snow constantly falls down onto the surface in a never ending stream.

Sol is the sunshine season, lasting for approximately 1 Earth season. During this time, the sun pierces through the clouds covering Kalt. The surface rarely warms above freezing during this time. There have been years where Sol never occurs, causing Kalt to be in an everlasting Snefald.

## Tajaran Society

Tajaran society is a sociable one. Due to the constant and continuous snowfall, Tajarans lack certain commodities that other planets and species may have, like most vehicles. Tajaran’s rely on each other in their tight communities, more so in times when supplies start to run low. Tajaran’s are also a very celebratory species. Even if a holiday is not their own, they’ll be more than happy to spend time with others. Even minor occurrences like birthdays, anniversaries or even when Sol finally comes, Tajarans will celebrate as if it was a major event.

### Holidays 

Tajaran’s currently celebrate the following holidays:

Mar 2nd - Solljarm - A day marked within Tajaran history. After a decade of Snefald, the sun finally rose over the horizon on Kalt. This monumental day was known as Solljarm, or, The Day the Sun Finally Rose. Snefald had not, prior nor current, lasted more than ten years.

Aug 4th - Kristne: Kristne is an important day for Tajaran’s. It's the birthday of their longest reigning monarch, who passed in the year 2509. The former monarch was beloved for nearly 150 years, before succumbing to natural causes one Sol day. Even in poor health, the monarch kept the streets cleared and the homes of many Tajaran’s warm every Snefald.

Tajaran’s are fully capable of space travel, as well as having two space faring vessels. However, due to Snefald lasting for an indeterminate amount of time, Tajaran’s are unable to enter space for many, many years. When Sol does occur, Tajarans request for supplies from many outside companies.

## Tajaran Politics & Government

Tajaran’s political government is a democratic-monarchy. The monarch no longer has political power on Kalt, having lost that in 2466 once the democratic house finally ruled and voted on it. Now, the monarch is a symbol of warmth and hope to the Tajaran’s. Many of them have posters, paintings or framed pictures of the current (or past) monarch in their homes, reminding them of hope.

The democratic side, however, is in control of society. They’re responsible for managing supplies and planning for eventual restocks. It’s also their job to regulate official holiday celebratory time. Major holidays can only be celebrated when the Heads of State permit so. Unofficial celebrations of unofficial holidays can be faced with severe punishment. The calendar has always had two official holidays, as present for the last fifty years. However, the calendar changes nearly yearly with holidays. The most a calendar has had was over 100 holidays listed within. The government holds no real tight grip on its people, enough to keep everyone happy. Due to the general weather of Kalt, there are only meetings during Sol. This is also when resupply operations occur.

## Tajaran specifics

The individual Tajaran enjoys a platter of farmed and wild game. They’re also capable of eating fruits and vegetables, but will always prefer game. Tajaran’s have a thick inner and outer coat of fur, capable of trapping heat and keeping them warm during the coldest of Snefald. Due to Sol not getting any hotter than freezing, Tajaran’s enjoy the pleasantly “warm” weather. Due to their thick fur, Tajaran’s are incapable of regulating their body temperatures in much hotter climates. Due to the typically darker days on Kalt during Snefald, Tajaran’s have superior eyes, heightened visibility in low-light environments.

Tajaran’s are also capable combatants, both close and ranged. Being armed with claws, Tajaran’s are capable of tearing flesh from one another, and due to their heightened sight, they’re excellent marksmen as well.

## Language

Tajaran's speak Tajara, a uncreative name bestowed to the Tajarans. Those unfamiliar with the language equate it to "cat meows" and "a whole lot of psp psp psp". Others have commented on how oddly romantic it sounds, maybe all those "cat got your tongue" phrases was referring to this. Tajara is still a hard langauge to understand and learn, but miles easier than Galactic Common.
