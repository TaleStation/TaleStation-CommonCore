# TaleStation History
TaleStation's conception was originally on January 19th, 2021. TaleStation was originally called *JollyStation*. 

## JollyStation Preface
JollyStation was originally a server hosted about once a week, and included a tight restriction on jobs and roles.

Command was dominated by the following characters,
- Captain - Gah-Jeelius
- Head of Security - Aza
- Research Director - Leclerc 
- Chief Engineer - Guirec Raaz
- Head of Personnel - Tracy Abbenson
- Chief Medical Officer - Rasha-Tanaka
- Quartermaster - Never occupied
- Bridge Officer - Teiya Azashan
- Asset Protection - Riley Bailey 

Command was heavily regulated, and players were expected to play certain jobs. Deviation always caused some strife and issues, even more so with the command regulation, but most respected the decision, sometimes "lending" the role to others if they were to be absent.

Lore was also somewhat inconsistent, but there was a central plot forming that never got to take off officially. Any important or funny lore events were document on the **Lore Timeline**. Users were also asked to add to the **Crew Manifest**, a formatted Google Doc to give their characters more of a face and background.

## JollyStation Jan 2021 - June 2021
The original JollyStation has been lost to time, since the original repository was Jolly's TG fork. However, the commit history has been archived [here](https://github.com/TaleStation/JollyStation-Commit-Archive).

JollyStation was spawned by Jolly, with the original intention to simply Roleplay with his friends. The reason why it was called JollyStation was because, Jolly is not a creative person when it comes to naming stuff. The entire premise of the code and server was never about him. 

The first PR that was made was for typing indicators. MrMelbert (Melbert) later came along and helped modularize the codebase, setting forward the modularization precedent. There wasn't a lot in code in the beginning, so this made the process a lot easier. Melbert is responsible for a lot of the work, both past and present, although, is no longer a contributor. 

For the first half of the year, JollyStation was a dedicated /TG/ fork (as a repository). However, Jolly decided to make a separate repository so that he could make future PRs for /TG/ (although, this would later result in the complete deletion of the fork, instead of resetting the commit history on master). 

## JollyStation June 2021 - Dec 2021
After the new repository was initialized and set up, things went as they always did. During the mid to late summer, the most notable event of JollyStation occured: the Beach Episode. Once the summer ended, regular hostings slowed due to many players going back to school. Around December, however, an unprofessional admin decision occurred that caused Jolly to forfeit the Discord, GitHub, and hosting privilege's. The Discord was forfeited to someone, GitHub was forfeited to MrMelbert, and hosting was forfeited to CRITAWAKETS. After Jollys departure from everything, the server quickly rebranded to MapleStation.

## JollyStation Jan 2022 - Mar 2022
JollyStation was brought back in Jan 2022, the ideas being continued where they were left off. Jolly had contacted Patchy, a friend of theirs, about help with hosting. Around the end of March, the PR Mirror bot had been initialized, and has been online since then. The server has been online for a little bit longer, due to less technical hiccups that occurred. 

## JollyStation Mar 2022 - August 2022
For most of the year, nothing significant happened.

On August 16th, 2022, JollyStation was officially killed off [here](https://github.com/TaleStation/TaleStation/pull/2053).

## TaleStation August 2022 - May 2023
TaleStation was born on August 16th, 2022. TaleStation was an idea for a few months. The major reason for the official rebrand was concerns over people assuming JollyStation was called what it was due to narcissistic implications. 

TaleStation had a proper reform, which is still undergoing to fulfill their purpose; to become a RP SS13 server that everyone can enjoy, with little involvement from mechanics.

On May 4th 2023, hosts were officially swapped. Patchy was removed from being the host, whilist ZephyrTFA became the new host.

## TaleStation May 2023 - Present
TaleStation is still thriving and is stronger than ever.

The mirror bot is still, unfortunately, a piece of hot garbage.

## Old JollyStation and "Old" JollyStation
Old JollyStation was killed off on August 16th, 2022. This was the continuation of ideas that Jolly had. TaleStation is a /TG/ downstream.

"Old" JollyStation is still running, which is now called MapleStation. MapleStation is the sister server to TaleStation. MapleStation is a /TG/ fork as of Feb 2022.

TaleStation and MapleStation have no direct interactions or relationships, but share the common conception.
